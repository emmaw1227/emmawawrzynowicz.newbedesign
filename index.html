                            <p>Pop Art was birthed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s amidst a postwar socio-political climate where artists turned toward celebrating commonplace objects and elevating the everyday to the level of fine art. Pop art drew upon everyday objects and media like newspapers, comic books, magazines, and other mundane objects to produce vibrant compositions, establishing the movement as a cornerstone of contemporary art. 
                              Pop art began in the mid-1950s in Britain by a group of painters, sculptors, writers, and critics called Independent Group. 
                              It spread soon after into the United States. Much of the movements roots were prompted by a cultural revolution led by activists, thinkers, and artists who aimed to restructure a social order ruled by conformity. 
                              Due to what was happening in that point of time new generation artists wanted something new.
                             Pop art used bright colors highly because of its ability to grab the attention quickly.
                              The predominant colors used by Pop Art artists are yellow, red and blue. The colors used were vivid. 
                              In contrast to other art movements, pop arts colors dont reflect the artists inner sensation of the world. Instead, these colors refer to the popular culture.
                              Instead, these colors refer to the popular culture.

                            <p>Humor was one of the main components of Pop art. Artists use the subject matter to make a statement about current events, poke fun at fads, and challenge the status quo.
                                Pop artists often took imagery from other areas of mainstream culture and incorporated it into their artworks, either altered or in its original form. This type of Appropriation art often worked hand in hand with repetition to break down the separation between high art and low art, which made the distinction between advertising and media from fine art.

                            <p>Andy Warhol was a successful magazine and ad illustrator who became a leading artist of the 1960s Pop art movements. He ventured into a wide variety of art forms, including performance art, filmmaking, video installations and writing and controversially blurred the lines between fine art and mainstream aesthetics. Warhol died on February 22, 1987, in New York City.

                        <p>He also painted celebrity portraits in vivid and garish colors; his most famous subjects include Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger and Mao Tse-tung. As these portraits gained fame and notoriety, Warhol began to receive hundreds of commissions for portraits from socialites and celebrities. Warhols life and work simultaneously satirized and celebrated materiality and celebrity. On the one hand, his paintings of distorted brand images and celebrity faces could be read as a critique of what he viewed as a culture obsessed with money and celebrity. On the other hand, Warholâ€™s focus on consumer goods and pop-culture icons, as well as his own taste for money and fame, suggests a life in celebration of the very aspects of American culture that his work criticized. 
                          Warhol used silkscreen printing, a process through which ink is transferred onto paper or canvas through a mesh screen with a stencil. Some of his most famous pieces are Marilyn Diptych, Campell Soup Cans, Mao, Banana, Flowers Series, and Cow Series.
